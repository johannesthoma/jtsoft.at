# [](#header-1)Software Developer Johannes Thoma

![](../../assets/images/JohannesThomaPressefoto2021Klein.jpg)

This is my personal site about software development and related
topics. I am Software Developer since many years now (started
programming at the age of 10 -- 41 years ago) and am specialized
in systems programming (mostly C stuff, but also some Rust now).

I am currently working on Open Source projects on behalf of
[LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com), a Vienna based company
focussed on OpenSource Software Defined Storage (SDS)
solutions for Cloud computing and related fields.

Besides programming I also play [Jazz Piano](http://www.johannesthoma.com)
and love to travel together with Nooshin my love.
