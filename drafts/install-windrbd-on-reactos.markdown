Run installer

Must patch registry to create the Virtual Bus Device
	(so that drbdadm primary works)

(reg files are on jtsoft.at in the home directory)
	Make sure that device numbers match...or so

VM is the reactos-debug-may2023 (where it is already
exiting). VNC port is 5959.

There also should be a newer VM based on reactos master...

And network requires netio.sys which I need to implement.
